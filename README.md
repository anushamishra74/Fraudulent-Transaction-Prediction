# Fraudulent-Transaction-Prediction
# Problem Statement

# Data Dictionary:

**step** - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation).

**newbalanceDest** - new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).

In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.
